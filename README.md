# U.S. States Guessing Game

This project is part of my 100 days of code in Python, and it represents my 25th day.

The game utilizes the Turtle graphics library to engage users in a guessing game focused on the names of the 50 U.S. states.

## How to Play

1. A map of the United States is displayed with all state names hidden.
2. Users are prompted to guess the names of the states.
3. Upon a correct guess, the state name is revealed on the map at its corresponding location.
4. To exit the game, users can input "Exit" or "Quit."
5. Missed states are saved to a CSV file named "States-to-learn.csv" for future learning.

## Files

- `main.py`: Contains the main game logic and setup.
- `50_states.csv`: CSV file containing the names and coordinates of the 50 U.S. states.
- `blank_states_img.gif`: Image file of the U.S. map with hidden state names.
- `States-to-learn.csv`: CSV file that stores missed states for further learning.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the `main.py` script.
3. Input state names when prompted and enjoy the interactive U.S. States guessing game.
